# Girafa
Girafa is a personal project where I developed a real-life product while learning, experimenting, and improving technologies that interest me.

The product is a social network focused on parties and nightclubs, offering users the ability to discover events, connect with people, and more.

Everything was done by me: product design, app, backend, and infrastructure.
